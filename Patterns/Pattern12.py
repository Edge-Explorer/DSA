# Given an integer n. 
# You need to recreate the pattern given below for any value of N. 
# Let's say for N = 5, the pattern should look like as below:

# 1        1
# 12      21
# 123    321
# 1234  4321
# 1234554321

# Print the pattern in the function given to you.

# Solution:

class Solution:
    def pattern12(self, n):
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            for j in range(1, i+1):
                print(j, end="")
            for j in range(2 * (n-i)):
                print(" ", end="")
            for j in range(i, 0, -1):
                print(j, end="")
            print()
